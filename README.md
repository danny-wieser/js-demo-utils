# js-demo-utils
A set of utilities for creating demo applications in Javascript, Redux and React

## Overview

Striving to avoid developing monolith javascript single-page apps, you may find yourself creating small components in individual repositories, with each including a barebones demo application to allow testing that component without needing to pull into a more complex parent application.

This library provides several utility functions for implementing those demo applications, with a main focus on a "data-service" component implemented using Redux.
